      <h1> Our Story </h1>
        <p> At E-Waste Express, we believe that protecting the planet shouldn't be complicated. Our journey began with a simple observation: homes and businesses 
          everywhere were filled with obsolete, damaged, or unused electronics taking up space, collecting dust, and eventually becoming harmful to the environment. 
          What started as a local initiative to help friends and neighbors responsibly dispose of their old electronics quickly grew into a full-fledged mission.
          We saw the need for a more convenient, eco-friendly solution so we built one.

      <h1> Sustainability </h1>
      <p> Electronic waste is one of the fastest-growing environmental challenges, and much of it ends up in landfills, leaking toxic materials into our soil and water. 
        At E-Waste Express, we’re committed to interrupting that cycle by ensuring every item we collect is processed through certified recycling partners or responsibly 
        refurbished. Our goal isn’t just to remove clutter it’s to reduce the carbon and chemical footprint of discarded electronics.
